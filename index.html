    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a high school student pursuing a
         computer science education and learning 
         web development. I love learning new skills that pique my interest. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I began learning web development in early July
          and have already completed several projects, including Tetris, Snake,
           a matrix, a calculator, and more.
        Ever since I took my first electronics class in school, I fell in love with technology and the programming within. 
        I went through the process of building and programming circuits which immediately 
        made me want to learn more and create better projects using my pre-existing knowledge.
